# 🪓 Hangman Game

This readme is also available in [Spanish](README.es.md)

A visual version of the classic **Hangman** game built with **Python** and **Pygame**. The player tries to guess a hidden word one letter at a time. With every wrong guess, a part of the hanged person appears on screen — until the full figure is drawn and the game is lost!
